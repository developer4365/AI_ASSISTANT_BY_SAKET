# Personal AI Assistant Development Plan

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Create project directory and virtual environment
- [x] Install required Python packages (speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pyautogui, pyaudio, requests for APIs)
- [x] Create main assistant script (assistant.py) with voice recognition and speech synthesis
- [x] Implement computer control functions (open apps, system commands)
- [x] Implement Android phone control functions using ADB
- [x] Implement command parser to interpret voice commands
- [x] Add web API integrations (e.g., web search, weather)
- [x] Test voice recognition and command execution
- [x] Finalize and run the assistant
- [x] Upload project to GitHub

## Notes:
- Ensure ADB is installed for Android control (user may need to install Android SDK Platform Tools)
- Test with microphone for voice input
- Handle permissions for system control
